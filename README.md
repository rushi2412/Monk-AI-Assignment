# Monk-AI-Assignment

Implement a 3-class classification neural network with a single hidden layer using Numpy.This model is a class of artificial neural network that uses back propagation technique for training. 
Algorithm -
Import Libraries - We will import some basic python libraries like numpy, matplotlib (for plotting graphs), sklearn (for data mining and analysis tool), etc. that we will need.
Dataset - We will use the Iris Dataset, It contains four features (length and width of sepals and petals) of 50 samples of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). It is a multi class classification problem. Now, let us divide the data into a training set and test set. This can be accomplished using sklearn train_test_split() function. 20% of data is selected for test and 80% for train. Also, we will check the size of the training set and test set. This will be useful later to design our neural network model.
Neural Network Model - 
The general methodology to build a Neural Network is to:
